# victor's first excel project
## Understanding student performance
We want to understand the factors that may contribute to student performance and make an informed decision on what to do to improve a student's performance.
*Note*
*This project is meant to be a non-technical way of analysing data. There are no statistical methods used apart from the regression coefficient to measure the significance of the data.*

## Dataset used
[student performance.xlsx](https://github.com/votene22/victor-s_portfolio/blob/main/student%20performance.xlsx)

## Questions/(KPIs)
- Does parental level of education improve student's performance?
- Are test scores affected by the quality of lunch in school?
- How do test scores in different subject affect the other subjects?
- Difference in test scores between genders

## Findings
### Student's parental level of education
When looking at parental level of education, it seems the average test scores per parental level of education increases the more educated the parent of the child is.

It's a pretty obvious finding but a 10 point increase in test scores between a high school education and a master's degree shows why schools often ask the parent about their education level to understand the student's support needs during schooling. As this could be a difference between a child getting a B in a test instead of an A.

### Lunch type on test scores
Using the free school meals slicer, this is further proven by the fact that test scores are worse by about 10 points by students that have free school meals compared to children who pay for their meals due to children who have free school meals are usually in a lower parental income. 
People who earn a higher amount are also more educated so this also explains how parental education affects children's test scores. [https://social-mobility.data.gov.uk/intermediate_outcomes/work_in_early_adulthood_(25_to_29_years)/income_returns_to_education/latest]
It also shows that while schools do accomodate for parent's level of income, it's still not enough to cover the gap and the advantage of a higher parental income.

### Relationship of test score on other test scores

From the image above, it's pretty clear that people who score higher in one test will score higher on other tests. This comes as no surprise since people who score higher are more likely to be hardworking and translate that hardwork to another test

### Gender differences

Lastly, females score higher on tests than males, I'm unsure on why that's the case but it's not by that much. 

## Conclusions
Analysing this data made me understand the significance that income levels/parental education have on the next generation, specifically the school system.
Schools can't change parents' qualification, but they can:
- provide extra help programmes such as mentoring for pupils whose families may struggle to give mentoring
- offer parent workshops on study strategies so families can better understand how to teach their kids at home
- A possibility of including breakfast clubs for children, ensuring children arrive to school early and start their day refreshed and ready for the day

## Limitations
- The old saying of correlation does not equal causation so these relationships are not a proof of impact
- Sample size is quite small so less confidence in findings
- No use of descriptive statistics such as ANOVA, significance test and data validation
