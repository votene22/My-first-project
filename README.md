# victor's first excel project
## Understanding student performance
We want to understand the factors that may contribute to student performance and make an informed decision on what to do to improve a student's performance.
*Note*
*This project is meant to be a non-technical way of analysing data. There are no statistical methods used apart from the regression coefficient to measure the significance of the data.*

## Dataset used
[student performance.xlsx](https://github.com/votene22/victor-s_portfolio/blob/main/student%20performance.xlsx)

## Questions/(KPIs)
- Does parental level of education improve student's performance?
- Are test scores affected by the quality of lunch in school?
- How do test scores in different subject affect the other subjects?
- Difference in test scores between genders
- Does the preparation course for the test have an effect on student's scores?

## Findings
### Student's parental level of education
When looking at parental level of education, it seems the average test scores per parental level of education increases the more educated the parent of the child is.

It's a pretty obvious finding but a 10 point increase in test scores between a high school education and a master's degree shows why schools often ask the parent about their education level to understand the student's support needs during schooling. As this could be a difference between a child getting a B in a test instead of an A.

### Quality of lunch on test scores

### Relationship of test score on other test scores

### Gender differences

### Preparation of course on student test scores
